# GifTastic
In this assignment, I created a dynamic web page that pre-populates with buttons representing an array of animals. When one of the buttons is clicked, the script makes an ajax call to a GIPHY API.
The request returns 10 static, non-animated gifs that are placed on the page along with the gif's rating and title. Each request brings 2 sets of urls containing src and data state. This is how image is toggled between static and animated.
When the user clicks on a gif image, the image animates and if the image is clicked again it will return to the static image.
I also added a form to the page containing an input field so the user can choose anything else they might like. The API requests have been limited to PG-13, and no more than 10 gifs at a time.
In my project, I used Bootstrap to help with the HTML layout and css styling. I also created my own css file to modify some of the style of the page to my liking. I also incorporated JavaScript to make the page dynamic, and jQuery to simplify many of my functions/objects. Since I never can leave well enough alone, I used Google Fonts to add an appropriate font to the project.
I found this poject to be very useful in practicing and deploying API requests, along with continuing to hone my skills in html, css and javascript.
My tutor was very helpful in teaching me the intricasies of the API call as well as how to sort all the information returned into the attributes I needed to complete the requirements of static and animated. 
In addition, I learned how to add autocomplete="off" to my form html to keep browser from trying to help with the input field.

I will continue to add to this project in the future to make it's appearance more pleasing, and also give the user more choices of where to find the gifs.
